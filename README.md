# PDFoundry

This is a simple Fork of PDFoundry, only change is to use an unchanged PDF.js build so download and printing works

THIS IS NOT TESTED IN DEPTH!

According to the orignial Author:

    "*You will cause multiple features to break if you use a version of PDF.js
    not built for PDFoundry.* This is not supported behavior and was
    deliberately not included. It may be one day but I see no clear solution
    for dealing with conflicts that will arise due to the multiple user nature
    of foundry and the single source nature of files."
    
So use on your own risk!
